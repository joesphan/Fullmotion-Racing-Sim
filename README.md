# Fullmotion-Racing-Sim
This is a dream project of mine for a while. Until I can price out a spec sheet that is under $300, I won't start building any hardware.
## Goals
4 axis
  pitch (forward backwards)
  roll (left right)
  rotation?   
  bumps (up/down)
  
At least 20 degrees of motion 
  +/- 10 degrees, modeled by D series pickup in BeamNG
   
Somewhat accurate bump simulation
  roughly 3,800 m/s/s to simulate a 45 degree ramp (1 x 1 meter) at 100km/h
   
Compatibility across games

  Problems
    Too expensive for my taste
    Motors cost $120 a piece, they need 6 of them
  Good
    I like the design, it simplifies the design of moving in all of the axis
    Easy calculations, all based on triangulation

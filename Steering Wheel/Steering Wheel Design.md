## Theory of Operation

-Atmega 32u4

-[FFB Library](https://github.com/YukMingLaw/ArduinoJoystickWithFFBLibrary) (thanks!)

-drill motor for "direct drive"

-old 2 bay NAS chassis for housing

Inside the ATmega32u4, the code will go something like this:

## Schematics

Note: 12V net port is not actually 12V

### H bridge Driver

This is a basic H bridge driver, supports PWM. Only thing is that there is absolutely no circuit protection, so should both analog pwm inputs be active, the HEXFETS will be no more.

The extra transistors tacked on are to create a 12V gate drive.

I simulated the circuit in [circuitmod](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuitmod/). Although I had access to MultiSim through my uni, the mentioned software is more accessible to most people and is fine.

The non-full voltage swing across the 10 ohm is caused by the limitation of the simulator's mosfet model. Putting another one in parallel solves this issue, by using a more appropriate MOSFET in the final design will be a better solution

### Power supply

The drill is a 120V drill. Running it on 12V DC provides good Locking torque, yet lacks power to come out of a locked stall.

A voltage doubler circuit would be utilized to boost the voltage to a decent amount.

#### Transform calculations

The circuit consisted of the transformer (secondary open) and a 100 ohm resistor in series. The smaller waveform is the measurement across the resistor while a signal was applied.

Calculations

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_L=2%20\pi%20fL)

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=L=\frac{2%20\pi%20f}{X_L})

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{1.44V}{.36V}=\frac{X_L+100}{100ohm})

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_L=300ohm)

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=L=\frac{300ohm}{2%20\pi%20103.1hz}=.463H)
